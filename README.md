AAU Software 2nd semester project

# Introduction
Welcome, welcome, welcoooooome!
This is the first bi-anual project that happens a whole two times a year.
Yes you head right a wopping two times!

Now you may say "(anouncer) what in the world are you talking about?". 
And I will say "HOW COME YOU DON'T KNOW?!?!? While, its a semester project of cause!"

Every year, two times a year, a group of inexperienced students partake in a "project".

What they don't know is that ***we*** are filming them the whole time, but don't tell them, that would spoil the fun.
And what fun it will be!

The winner group(s) will be able to return to the next round. There are in total a wopping 6 rounds, and if they make it out alive, they might get a job.

If they happen loose (*audience makes sad noices*), they are eliminated, **OR** they go on a bonus double or nothing round (add: some loosers come again, we can't control them).

If you have watched our past shows, you might want to stick around and see some old faces. Some past winners have chosen to go on for a fantastic 4 seasons more, and aren't we happy!
This time the challanges are even harder and the stakes... there are some stakes.

This has been your anouncer, now to the show.
